overviewSection: Proper device handling during collaborative activities is
  essential for participant safety and equipment protection. Provide clear
  guidelines, demonstrate correct handling, and use child-friendly devices when
  possible. Consider protective cases for fragile devices and have facilitators
  nearby to offer support and intervene if needed.

  [Bridges Canada](https://www.bridges-canada.com/), a partner in the [Weavly](https://weavly.org/) project, developed a straightforward social story on handling robots. Before using robots in any session, we would review a few slides to emphasize that robots are not toys but fragile items requiring careful handling. Children were reminded to wait for their turn to use them. The image above illustrates one of the slides from this deck.

## Description

Device handling during a collaborative activity is crucial to ensure the safety of both the participants and the equipment being used. Be aware that some participants may require extra support due to their unique needs. For example, if a participant tends to throw or drop devices despite instructions, work closely with them to find alternative ways of engagement or provide additional sensory tools to help them regulate their behavior. 

## Suggestions

### Creating and Demonstrating Guidelines

Prepare a clear and straightforward guideline for handling the devices. Use simple language and visuals if necessary, especially for children who may have communication challenges.

Before distributing the devices to the participants, explain the guideline to them and demonstrate how to handle a device correctly. Show them the dos and don'ts to avoid accidental damage or mishandling to reinforce the guidelines.

### Using Protective Measures

Whenever possible, use devices specifically designed for children. Kid-friendly devices are more likely to withstand the wear and tear of a collaborative workshop.

If using fragile or sensitive devices, such as tablets or laptops, consider adding protective cases or covers to prevent damage in case of accidental drops. 

Using shock-absorbent materials on the surface area where the activities are taking place can minimize potential damages.

### Facilitator Support and Supervision

Have a facilitator or team member close by during the activity to provide additional support and supervision and remind participants about proper handling techniques and intervene if they notice any unsafe behaviors.
