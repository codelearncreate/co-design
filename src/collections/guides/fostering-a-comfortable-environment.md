## Description
In any direct interaction with children with disabilities, creating a comfortable and trusting environment is essential for their active participation. Getting to know you and any new team members beforehand can significantly impact how they feel around you and their willingness to share their ideas.
Allow sufficient time for the participating children to become familiar with the co-design team. Building trust may require multiple sessions, but it's crucial for their engagement.
Use familiar settings. Collaborate with parents and teachers to find opportunities to be present in environments where the children are familiar with. 
## Suggestions
### Assisting Teachers
Offer your assistance to teachers during a couple of classes, and engage alongside the children. Your presence helps the children become more comfortable with you over time.
### Shadowing Classes
Request permission to shadow a class for a week or several days. This extended interaction allows the children to get used to your presence and feel more relaxed.
### Recognizing the child’s preferred modes of communication
Some children prefer alternative modes of communication to speech, be it touch, AAC, picture cards, or even gestures. Get to know the child’s preferred modes of communication so that you can communicate with them within their preferences. 
### Sharing welcome videos or pictures
Prepare a short video, or a series of picture cards that feature you and any other facilitators to introduce yourselves and share that you will be meeting them soon to work on a cool project. 
### Getting to know daily routines
Collaborate with the family in getting to know the children’s daily routines. Knowledge of the family’s activities will help you understand the child’s schedule, which you could even reference when communicating with the child. 
### Being present with the children
Take some time to show your materials—prototypes, cameras, toys—to the child and let them explore these items. Allowing the child to know your materials will help them feel safe with unfamiliar items and activities to come.
