## Description

After each collaborative session, take the time to reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Incorporate these insights into your future workshops to continually enhance the co-design experience and offer different ways to allow for expression of creative ideas.

## Suggestions

### Understanding Individual Needs

Engage in discussions with other facilitators to gain a comprehensive understanding of each child's individual needs and how they could have been better supported to participate and contribute effectively during the workshop.

### Logistics Evaluation

Evaluate the workshop logistics, including the timing, frequency and duration of breaks, the workshop environment, and the arrangement of furniture and materials. Identify potential improvements that can enhance the overall experience in future sessions.

### Promoting Inclusivity

Reflect on how inclusive the workshop truly was and whether all participants felt engaged, valued, and heard. Seek ways to further promote inclusivity and equal participation for all children. Discuss who else should have been participating in the workshop and their perspectives were missing. 

### Supporting Open Communication

Encourage open communication among the facilitators and team members, fostering an environment where ideas and suggestions are welcomed and valued. Collaborate to generate creative solutions to challenges encountered during the workshop.

### Documenting Action Items

Document the debriefing sessions and compile a list of action items by the end of the meeting. These action items serve as a valuable reference for implementing changes and enhancements in subsequent workshops.
