## Description

The primary goal of a collaborative workshop with children with disabilities is to provide them with ample opportunities to express their ideas and actively contribute to project development. However, due to each child's unique needs, direct participation may present challenges. Some participants may face difficulties holding a pen, drawing in a specific direction, moving without assistive devices, or sharing their ideas verbally.

In such collaborative settings, caregivers — such as teachers, parents, or guardians — are often present, and their instinct to help may lead them to intervene when a child is struggling to participate. They may hold the child's hand, interpret facial expressions on their behalf, or even complete an activity on their behalf. As facilitators, it is essential to be mindful of these situations. 

## Suggestions

### Respectful Space

In some scenarios, it may be appropriate to respectfully request caregivers to step back, fostering children's independence during collaborative activities.

### Minimal Physical Support

When physical support is necessary, caregivers can be asked to offer only essential assistance without directing the child's actions.

### Objective Communication

Encourage caregivers not to interpret the child's messages but to communicate observations objectively, especially crucial for non-verbal children. It's vital to be neutral and descriptive rather than potentially biased in interpretations.

### Diverse Collaboration Tools

Working with teachers, caregivers, or parents ahead of time helps understand specific access needs and modes of participation for each child. This knowledge enables the preparation of tools and methods that better support each child’s engagement. 

* If a child needs support holding a pen, providing a bulky pen with a wristband can aid their participation in drawing activities.
* For those who use symbol-based communication, having Yes/No cards and other feedback cards readily available allows for direct and efficient communication during discussions.
