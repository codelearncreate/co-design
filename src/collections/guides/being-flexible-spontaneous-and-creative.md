## Description

Flexibility and adaptability are essential traits for facilitators working with children with disabilities, as unexpected behaviors may require thoughtful and spontaneous responses to ensure a positive and meaningful collaborative experience for all participants. Unforeseen situations and unexpected behaviors may arise during the workshop. The facilitation team needs to be prepared to embrace spontaneity and their plans accordingly. This might involve introducing impromptu activities or modifying existing ones to better suit the present or stopping the session altogether and rescheduling for another time.
