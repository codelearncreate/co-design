subtitle: This toolkit offers a set of strategies and guidelines to support
  educators, designers, researchers, or anyone else who aims to engage children
  with disabilities in a creative process and enable their creative expression.

    ### Why do co-design with children with disabilities?


    Children with disabilities are greatly impacted by the design of products, services, and environments around us. Unfortunately, they are often left out of the research, design, and development processes, pushed to the sidelines while decisions are made on their behalf by adult designers and researchers who may not have lived/living experiences of disability and being Deaf. Even when their caregivers or parents are involved, the children themselves are rarely given a voice.


    By directly engaging and co-creating with children with disabilities, we can gain invaluable insights into their needs and preferences. No more assuming what they like or need; instead, we'll work directly with them to co-create something they can use and enjoy. However, it might be challenging to encourage these young individuals’ active participation and expression of ideas in a collaborative process. Many factors, including their physical abilities, environmental, psychological, and social context can interfere with their participation.


    ### Goals of this toolkit


    This toolkit is about fostering direct interactions with children with disabilities, empowering them to share their creativity and ideas. We'll share experiences about how to learn from their unique perspectives, uncover needs, challenges, and gaps that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. This toolkit is an ever-growing collection that thrives on the contributions of researchers and designers who decide to share their experiences in a public forum.

  title: How to use this toolkit
  content: >-
    The content of this toolkit is organized by three areas we need to consider
    when planning to have a collaborative session that requires children to
    express their thoughts and ideas. These three areas are not presented in a
    linear fashion and they can happen at any order and at any point of the
    collaboration process with children with disabilities, sometimes they can
    all happen at once.


    ### Planning


    In this section, we focus on setting up for the interaction. We share some of our experiences, tools, and strategies that help us create an accessible environment where children feel safe and comfortable to share their ideas. 


    ### Doing


    In this section, we focus on the moments of interaction with children. We talk about some of the techniques and strategies we use to moderate the interaction between the educator/designer/researcher and children with disabilities in a more inclusive and accessible way.


    ### Reflecting


    This section focuses on interpreting the interaction. Here we share experiences on how we analyze and frame what we have collected during different moments of interaction with children with disabilities.

  content: This toolkit has been developed based on the experiences of
    practitioners who are actively working with children with disabilities to
    co-design different products, services, and programs. This is a
    community-based resource, and practitioners, researchers, and educators are
    encouraged to modify this content and add to it based on their experiences.

  title: The ground rules
  content: >-
    Throughout this toolkit, we ground our work in the following rules to
    meaningfully collaborate with children with disabilities and enable their
    participation.


    ### Make it in-person


    The experiences shared in this toolkit are based on face-to-face interactions with children with disabilities. Virtual interactions won’t create the same collaborative environments, and we may miss out on whole-body expressions and other environmental cues.


    ### Make it a long-term commitment


    Most of the strategies and techniques shared here are based on long-term interactions with children with disabilities. Through short-term and one-off interactions, we are not able to fully understand their needs and make them feel comfortable interacting with us.


    ### Take a flexible approach


    Each child is different, and there are no fixed solutions, tools, or techniques to help us co-design with them. This toolkit is a place to reflect on what we have experienced through years of collaboration with children with disabilities, not to try to prescribe specific approaches or solutions.
